### E2E test design: service-layer testing without RCON dependency
**By:** Nightwing
**What:** The 5 E2E test scenarios in `EndToEndScenarioTests.cs` test the .NET service layer (Bridge.Api + Redis event consumer + WorldGen job queue) via HTTP API and Redis events, without depending on Minecraft RCON commands succeeding. This means they can validate the entire data pipeline even when Minecraft is slow to start or RCON times out.
**Why:** The existing acceptance tests (`VillageCreationTests`, `TrackRoutingTests`, etc.) all depend on BlueMap markers, which require Minecraft + Paper MC + BlueMap to be fully running. These are flaky in CI due to container startup times. The new E2E tests validate the same data flow at the service layer, giving faster feedback. Track job verification is inherently timing-sensitive because the WorldGenJobProcessor may process the job before we can observe it in the Redis queue — the test uses Crossroads API validation as a fallback assertion. Building styles (MedievalCastle/TimberCottage/StoneWatchtower) are a WorldGen-layer concept not persisted in the DB, so they can't be verified via API — only building index assignment and associations are testable at this layer.
