### 2026-02-13: User directive — Crossroads of the World central hub
**By:** Jeff (via Copilot)
**What:** Create a "Crossroads of the World" central area where all village train lines connect. This hub should be very ornate with decorative fountains, trees lining the streets, and other Minecraft decorative elements. Players can take a train from the crossroads to any outer village directly.
**Why:** User request — creates a natural central spawn point and simplifies navigation between villages (hub-and-spoke vs point-to-point).
