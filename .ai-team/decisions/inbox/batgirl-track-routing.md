### 2026-02-12: Track routing triggered by village creation completion
**By:** Batgirl
**What:** WorldGenJobProcessor now automatically enqueues CreateTrack jobs after each CreateVillage job completes successfully. For each new village, one CreateTrack job is enqueued per existing non-archived village, connecting the new village to the entire network. The first village in the world gets no track jobs (handled gracefully with an informational log). Track jobs are enqueued AFTER village generation is marked Completed, ensuring the village structure is fully built before any track generation begins. Station signs at existing villages are updated naturally — each CreateTrack job invokes TrackGenerator which creates new station platforms with destination signs at both the source and destination village.
**Why:** Track routing must be a post-completion concern of the job processor, not the event consumer, because the village must be fully built before tracks can connect to it. Using the existing WorldGenJob queue pattern keeps track generation async, retryable, and consistent with all other generation work. The TrackGenerator already builds platforms with signs at both ends of each track, so no separate "update signs" mechanism is needed — connecting a new village to an existing one naturally creates a new platform with signs at the existing village.
