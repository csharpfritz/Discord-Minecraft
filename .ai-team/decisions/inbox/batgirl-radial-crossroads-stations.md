### 2026-02-14: Crossroads station platforms use radial orientation
**By:** Batgirl
**What:** Crossroads station platforms are now oriented radially — stations on the east/west sides of the hub run east-west (track along X axis), while stations on the north/south sides run north-south (track along Z axis). Track approach paths choose L-path direction so the final segment aligns with the destination station's orientation. CrossroadsGenerator placeholder "Slot N" platforms replaced with cobblestone walkways from plaza edge (radius 30) to station ring (radius 35). TrackGenerator also generates a cobblestone walkway from each Crossroads station back toward the plaza.
**Why:** Previously all 16 Crossroads stations ran north-south regardless of their position around the hub, requiring ugly L-turns right at the station entrance. Radial orientation means a player arriving from the east approaches the station head-on along the track — no abrupt turn at the platform. The `StationOrientation` enum (in `Bridge.Data/WorldConstants.cs`) is shared so both generators can reason about orientation. Placeholder slot signs were removed because TrackGenerator already builds proper stations with signs, dispensers, and shelters — the duplicated infrastructure was confusing and sometimes misaligned.
