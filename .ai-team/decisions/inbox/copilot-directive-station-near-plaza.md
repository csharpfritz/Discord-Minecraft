### 2026-02-13: User directive — Train stations near plaza
**By:** Jeff (via Copilot)
**What:** Train stations should be positioned near the village plaza, not far away. The plaza is "village central" so the station should feel connected to it.
**Why:** User request — improves village cohesion and makes the spawn/teleport experience better when players arrive at a village.
