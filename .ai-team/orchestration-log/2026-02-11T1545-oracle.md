### 2026-02-11T15:45 — Sprint 1: Discord bot shell + RCON PoC (S1-05, S1-06)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent routed** | Oracle (Integration Dev) |
| **Why chosen** | S1-05 (RCON) and S1-06 (Discord bot) are both integration concerns — Oracle's domain |
| **Mode** | `background` |
| **Why this mode** | Known inputs from architecture doc; no dependency on Lucius's scaffolding output |
| **Files authorized to read** | docs/architecture.md, docs/sprints.md |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | tools/RconTest/*, src/DiscordBot.Service/* |
| **Outcome** | Completed — RCON PoC with CoreRCON 5.4.2, Discord bot shell with Discord.Net 3.18.0 and /ping command |
