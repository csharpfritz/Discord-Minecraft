## Additional Activity

- **Gordon** scoped BlueMap integration as Issue #10 (S3-08)

## PRs Opened

- **PR #8** — Batgirl (minecart tracks)
- **PR #9** — Oracle (Paper Bridge Plugin)

## Key Findings

- **Nightwing** identified a gap in channel deletion handler: the current `DiscordEventConsumer.HandleChannelDeletedAsync` only sets `IsArchived = true` in the database but does NOT enqueue an archive job to the Redis worldgen queue. Sprint 3 acceptance criteria (S3-05) requires archive jobs for sign updates (`[Archived]` prefix) and barrier placement. Lucius addressed this in his S3-05 implementation.
